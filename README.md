# Building documenting and logging

## Setting up composer 

install :

### Install Breeze and dependencies...
```
composer require laravel/breeze
php artisan breeze:install api
```

This is to allow us to haven an api which we will use in many diffrent ways from this point



###Laravel Breeze - Next.js Edition

I am using this as a way to make it build it all out as needed


This is some notes taken from the README.md from this repo
Next, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and supply the URL of your backend:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Finally, run the application via `npm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.
